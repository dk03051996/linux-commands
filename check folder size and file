For folder 

du -hs important
it will list the size of folder important or we can write the path 
where -h represent human readbale form like kb mb gb 
-s represent specific option of that folder



du -ha /home/ubuntu/important/
it will list the size of that folder and size of files and subfolder inside it

du -h /var/www/assets | sort -rh
it will do the same but it will print in reverse order i.e. from heavy size to low


For file


ls -lh
-h represent human readbale form

ls -lh page1.html
